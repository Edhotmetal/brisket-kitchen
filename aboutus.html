		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<h3>Bring you fresh, local cuisine inspired by and created for our community</h3>
	    </li>
		<p>
		    The Brisket Kitchen has been family owned since 1979.

		<h2>The Owners</h2>
		    <p>
			Owners Leon and Shelby have been passionate about smoked and grilled
			delicacies ever since they first saw their father build a smokehouse
			on the family farm. Since then, the Hornady family has been
			enjoying Thanksgiving Brisket in lieu of Turkey and has never looked back!
			In 1978, Leon and Shelby decided to bring the joy of Thanksgiving
			brisket to their local community. It was such a hit that they opened
			their own restaurant the very next year.
